# How to use the gateway-cli
The gateway must be running in order for the CLI commands to work (otherwise tags cannot be found).
More information on when and how to start it can be found [here](./useful_tips.md).
## Basic command structure of the client
The commandline interface (cli) is structured as expressive cli.
```{ bash }
gw <command> <subcommand> <subcommand>... --<flag> <named_argument> <argument>
```
Example:  
The following prompt will get all tags and their measurements that are known by the gateway and dump them as a json to the given file.
```{bash}
gw tags get --file test.json
```
This will do the same thing but only with one tag (in this case ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff):
```{bash}
gw tags get --address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff --file test.json
```
## Help - I'm stuck!
just type "help" at any point
```{bash}
gw tags get --help
```
# Exposed functions
## get
Get will always instruct the gateway to fetch data from one or more tags. It will not always return data directly, usually the `gw tags get` prompt is used to fetch data.
### tags
This command fetches tag information from the gateway and returns them into go structs. If --file is given, the data will be output as a json into the given file.
```{bash}
gw tags get --address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff --file test.json
```

### config
Gets the config from one or more tags. Will only report if it was fetched successfully.
```{bash}
gw tags get config --address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

### time
Gets the time from one or more tags. Will only report if it was fetched successfully.
```{bash}
gw tags get time --address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

### acceleration_log
Will fetch an acceleration log from one or more tags. As soon as the first tag returns its values, it is going to dump all measurements to the given --file filename as json.
```{bash}
gw tags get acceleration_log --address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff --file test.json
```

## set
Sets parameters on one or more tags - depends on --address
### config
Validates and sets the given config to one or more tags. If values are not valid, the old value will be set again. --config has to be a valid json.
```{bash}
gw tags set config --address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff --config '{""}'
```

### time
Sets the current time on one or more tags - depends on --address
```{bash}
gw tags set time --address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

### heartbeat
Sets the heartbeat on one or more tags - depends on --address. --heartbeat is mandatory!
```{bash}
gw tags set heartbeat --address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff --heartbeat 10
```

## stop
Commands that are able to stop processes on a tag. Until now you can only stop acceleration logging
```{bash}
gw tags stop acceleration_log --address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```
